name="(part._.Scholastic_.Game_.Jam)"></a>Scholastic Game Jam</h2><p>Welcome to the official Scholastic Game Jam rules.</p><p>What is the Scholastic Game Jam?  It&rsquo;s a competition in which
players have a limited amount of time to create a
video game on a theme announced on the day of the
competition.</p><p>Games are scored:</p><p>1) Objectively, based on the
presence or absence of certain game features.</p><p>2) Subjectively, based on how
creatively these features are rendered.</p><p>Winning teams usually receive some kind of prize.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.How_to_.Enter)"></a>How to Enter</h3><p>Your school must be a participating school with
a registered team.  If this is the case, your
school&rsquo;s coach will take care of registration
for your team.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Day_of_.Competition)"></a>Day of Competition</h3><p>On the day of competition (or before), the coach will
register each student on the school&rsquo;s team and will
also note which students will be competing solo
and which will be competing in pairs.</p><p>The players will sit in their designated area and
await the announcement of the Game Jam prompt.
Until the day of competition, the prompt is a closely
guarded secret.  When the prompt is announced, all
teams may begin working on their game immediately.
They may continue until the scoring phase begins.</p><p>During the scoring phase, judges will calculate a
final score for each team.  The final score is calculated
as the sum of every game&rsquo;s score, divided by the number of
players on the team.  (For players competing in pairs,
the game&rsquo;s score is doubled.)</p><h4>2.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Example)"></a>Example</h4><p>Suppose a team consists of Jimmy, Sally, Marco, and Marta.
Suppose that Jimmy and Marco are competing as a pair.
Now, suppose the final game scores are as follows:</p><p>1) 100 points for Jimmy and Marco&rsquo;s game.
2) 100 points for Sally&rsquo;s game.
3) 100 points for Martha&rsquo;s game.</p><p>Jimmy and Marco receive 200 points for their game,
because they are a pair.  This means the team&rsquo;s
total is 400 points.  The final score for the team
would be 400 points divided by the 4 players.</p><p>Or 100 points.</p><p>This is the score that judges will use to rank teams.
If no other team has a better score than 100, then
Jimmy, Sally, Marco, and Martha&rsquo;s team wins.</p><p>Teams must have between 6 and 10 players and must
be registered prior to the start of competition.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.How_are_.Games_.Scored_)"></a>How are Games Scored?</h3><p>Judges will use the a rubric to score games.
The rubric will be announced more than 8 weeks
before the day of competition (and often will
be announced many months before).  The upcoming
rubric is as follows:</p><p>Game Type: Survival Game with Crafting</p><p>Scorable Features:</p><p>* avatar
* Inventory Items
* Food
* Crafting/Recipes
* Non-Player Characters</p><h4>3.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Score_.Sheet)"></a>Score Sheet</h4><p>For convenience, we&rsquo;ve created this scoresheet
for players, coaches, spectators, and judges to
use.  It is intended to serve as a quick overview
of the scoring system.  For more details,
see the following sections.</p><p>&lt;Score sheet...&gt;</p><h4>3.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Avatar)"></a>Avatar</h4><p>The game must have an avatar that can be moved
with the arrow keys.  The avatar must lose health
over time and must gain health by eating food.</p><p>Computer-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 for having an avatar at all
* +5 sprint bonus.  Implement an avatar within the
first 5 minutes of the competition.
* +1 per animation frame. Max +4</p><p>Human-Scored Points:</p><p>* +5 for walking animation
* +5 for theme cohesion</p><h4>3.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Example)"></a>Example</h4><p>Suppose the Game Jam prompt is announced to be: "Slimes vs Unicorns.
Slimes have taken over the forest, and the unicorns must learn to
survive in the desert."</p><p>Suppose that within the first 5 minutes of the competition, Marco creates a
avatar that looks like a red circle.  This qualifies him for a +5 sprint bonus.</p><p>Suppose he goes on to create three animation frames of unicorn walking,
which his avatar use while walking and replaces the red circle with these
animation frames.  (The sprint bonus has already been awarded, so he does
not lose the bonus points.)</p><p>Computer-awarded points:
* +1 for having an avatar
* +3 for his animation frames</p><p>Human-awarded points:
* +5 for the fact that the animation is a walking animation (as opposed to just
three random images).
* +5 for the fact that the animation depicts a unicorn.  (A slime would also
have been acceptable.)</p><p>The total would be +19 points.</p><h4>3.4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Food)"></a>Food</h4><p>The game must have food items that the avatar
can consume in-game.</p><p>Computer-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 for each food item in game.  Max +10.
* +5 sprint bonus.  Implement at least one food
item within the first 10 minutes of the competition.</p><p>Human-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 per food item for theme cohesion.  Max +10</p><h4>3.5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Example)"></a>Example</h4><p>Suppose (as in the example in the previous section) that
Marco creates three food items:</p><p>* Prickly Pears, which give the avatar +1 health
* Sand Bread, which gives the avatar +5 health
* Prickly Pear Pie, which gives the avatar +10 health</p><p>Also, suppose he created the berries within the first 10 minutes of
the competition.  This would qualify him for a +5 sprint bonus.</p><p>Furthermore, he would recieve:</p><p>* +3 for the food items (+1 for each) &ndash; simply for having them.
* +3 for each item that pertains to the theme (presumably Prickly Pears,
Sand Bread, and Prickly Pear Pie can help unicorns survive in the desert).</p><p>That would be a total of +11 points.  Added to his
previous score of +19, that would be +30 points so far!</p><h4>3.6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Non-.Food_.Items)"></a>Non-Food Items</h4><p>The game must have non-food items that can be
picked up and used for crafting.</p><p>Computer-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 for each non-food item in game.  Max +10.
* +5 sprint bonus.  Implement at least one non-food
item within the first 15 minutes of the competition.</p><p>Human-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 per non-food item for theme cohesion.  Max +10</p><h4>3.7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Example)"></a>Example</h4><p>Suppose we continue our example from the previous section.
Marco creates on non-food item &ndash; a Sand Grinding Rock.
But suppose he loses some time because he must track down a
bug in his code.  He ends up completing his Sand Grinding Rock by the 16-minute
mark.  This means he cannot get the sprint bonus in this category.</p><p>However, he does recieve +1 for having an item and +1 for
the fact that a Sand Grinding Rock does sound like something a unicorn
might need to survive in a desert.</p><p>That&rsquo;s +2 in this category.  He&rsquo;s at +32 so far.</p><h4>3.8<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Non-.Player_.Characters)"></a>Non-Player Characters</h4><p>The game must have Non-Player Characters (NPCs).</p><p>Computer-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 for each NPC in game.  Max +5.
* +1 for each line of dialog an NPC has (Max +4 per NPC).
* +5 sprint bonus.  Implement at least one NPC
within the first 20 minutes of the competition.</p><p>Human-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 per NPC for theme cohesion.  Max +5.
* +1 for each line of dialog an NPC has that is cohesive with
the theme (Max +4 per NPC).</p><h4>3.9<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Example)"></a>Example</h4><p>Suppose, in our running example, Marco creates
1 NPC by the 19-minute mark.</p><p>The NPC is a desert nomad with two lines of
dialog about the weather in the desert and one
line about how to make Prickly Pear Pie.</p><p>Marco would receive the sprint bonus of +5, along
with +1 for having an NPC and +3 for its lines of dialog.
Since the NPC looks it belongs in the
desert, Marco would also get an additional +1.  And
since the dialog lines are all theme-cohesive, he would
get an additional +3.</p><p>That&rsquo;s a total of: +13.  He now has +45 total.</p><h4>3.10<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Crafting_.Recipes_.Tech-tree)"></a>Crafting/Recipes/Tech-tree</h4><p>The game must have "recipes", allowing new items
to be created from existing ones.</p><p>A recipe involves three things:</p><p>* Inputs.  A list of input items.  E.g. marshmallows,
chocolate, and crackers.
* Output.  A single output item.  E.g. a chocolate s&rsquo;more.
* Trigger. An in-game entity that serves as the place
where the recipe can be triggered. E.g. a campfire.</p><p>Note that the word "recipe" does not imply
that the inputs or outputs must be food.  Here&rsquo;s
another example:</p><p>* Inputs.  A list of input items.  E.g. wood and matches.
* Output.  A single output item.  E.g. a campfire.
* Trigger. An in-game entity that serves as the place
where the recipe can be triggered. E.g. a firepit.</p><p>And yes, the output of one recipe can become
either the inputs of another recipe or even the
trigger for another recipe.  For example, to make
s&rsquo;mores, you may have to first produce a campfire.</p><p>Computer-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 for each recipe in game.  Max +10.
* +1 for each ingredient in a recipe.  Max +4 per recipe.
* +5 sprint bonus.  Implement at least one recipe
within the first 25 minutes of the competition.</p><p>Human-Scored Points:</p><p>* +1 per recipe for theme cohesion.  Max +10
* +1 for each theme-cohesive ingredient in a recipe.  Max +4 per recipe.</p><p>Note that all recipes must be craftable in game.</p><h4>3.11<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Example)"></a>Example</h4><p>Suppose, in our running example, Marco creates two
recipes:</p><p>* Triggered at the cooking cauldron: Prickly Pears + Sand Bread can make Prickly Pear Pie.
* Triggered at the cooking cauldron: Sand + Sand Grinding Rock makes Sand Bread</p><p>These recipes form a chain (one is the input to another)</p><p>&lt;Tree or chain?  Can we simplify this??
